Clang wasm related binaries, packaged for npm. Not affiliated with the clang project in anyway, just an easy way to compile wasm on any system, from a script.

Binaries downloaded from http://releases.llvm.org/download.html .

LLVM homepage is http://llvm.org/ , read more about LLVM and clang there (again, I not affliated with them in any way).
